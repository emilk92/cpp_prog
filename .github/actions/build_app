# All actions have a name that will be displayed in the "Actions" page in GitHub.
name: CI


# The "on" option will specify when to run this action and on which branch
# Usually for a CI action you would like to run it on every pull request and on push
# For CD you would probably only want to run it on closed pull requests or direct pushes on master
# If you want to run it manually you would add "worflow_dispatch"
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

# The whole action can contain sub-items called jobs
# Jobs are run separately and will spin up a new build machine for each sub-item
jobs:
  # Under jobs you can put whatever name you want

  # This is just a custom name "build" but it can be anything
  build:
    runs-on: debian-latest

    # Steps are the individual actions for each job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # Usually this is always needed
